Particularly interesting to me are the works of Mitin, who was the main Soviet philosopher to overthrow Deborin, and reigned over Soviet DiaMat into the Gorby years. His philosophy was often called the "New Philosophy" in the 1930s, and was a direct influence on Ai Siqi and Mao. But there are plenty of historical and political books as well.

However, all things come with their darker sides: the violence of knighthood and the bloodshed associated with religious zeal; Bladud's necromancy, and how his imagination lead to his death.

Thought it would be useful to get an app recommendation thread going for those of us who still use BB10 devices as our daily drivers. I'll get this going, and try to stick with applications that fulfill day-to-day needs, while giving preference to native ones. Though Android apps will definitely not be excluded, I will only list those that work wonderfully with BB10 (E.g. being able to write to the sd card). These will all be quality apps. I'm on a Classic BTW. Maybe if we get enough input. Having used Pocket's article-archival-and-management tool -- sort of a bookmarks-on-steroids product -- for the past year or two, and with news that the company has just been acquired by Mozilla (it's been getting increasingly integrated into Firefox over the past year or so), I've realised one of my most fundamental complaints about it. The more I use Pocket, the worse it gets. As I've mentioned (a few too many times), I do a lot of research, much of it with articles and documents

I have a few books in DJVU format and I'd like to be able to read them on my phone, seeing as that's where I do most of my reading these days. It seems like there are a few apps on Google Play that offer this, but most have few (or no) reviews, and I'd rather get recommendations from actual users. I did do a search in the sub, but the only posts on this were from two years ago, and the only app recommended was EBookDroid, which doesn't look ideal. I'm hoping better options have popped Oh, I forgot, I also need to open books in the form of epub djvu, would the standard PDF reader for fedora. I know the Perseus Project and Textkit sites contain the works of several Greek authors online, but the texts seem to be integrated into the websites themselves, whereas I'm seeking something in a more reader-friendly format. Specifically I am interested in trying to read Aristotle and some of the early Greek Church Fathers in the original, but I'm curious where I should go in general to find Greek texts as pdf or djvu files instead of directly integrated into a website. A ~~brief~~ (who was I kidding?) note on research tools I've found useful, to at least some extent, in acquiring, assimilating, converting, and organising infromation. If you're looking for a total solution, you are apt to be disappoint. I certainly am. But these have been a start. Where I can, I obtain materials online. The Internet Archive (https://www.archive.org) has a fantastic, and legal, compendium of texts. Project Gutenberg (https://www.gutenberg.org/wiki/Main_Page) I have noticed that a number of redditors in this /r/indonesia are quite young, so they might not remember how life was really like under orba. It's important to know our history. Especially our recent history, which still assert a great influence on our today. It is even more important to know about this recent history in light of current attempts at historical revisionism by some people in the election campaign. So, as my contribution to "melawan lupa" (the fight against forgetting) I am currently using Kindle Paperwhite and would like to purchase another e-reader. Most books that I read are epub, comic book formats. I rarely venture into pdf or djvu formats. Which one do you suggest me to go for? Also, should I wait a little longer for any new models coming. Since I've seen a few posts regarding textbooks, I highly suggest checking out libgen.info before buying, since it has a decent amount of books uploaded to it and you don't have to deal with torrenting (for those of you who are going to be living on campus) They usually come in PDF format, but sometimes they may be a DjVu file, which is easy to use once you get a DjVu reader (just google it and one will come up). The website also has some solution manuals for some textbooks which really Hi, I just wanted to share my experience of reading ebooks on various tablet, and how it felt comparatively. It might be of interest to people who are looking for a tablet primarily as a reading device, and by that I mean refrence/text reading (mainly pdf, scanned books or ebooks) and general reading ( mobi, epub, comics). I have used following tablets in past : nexus 7, nexus 9, Samsung tab s 8.4 ( also tab pro, but for this analysis, s 8.4 and pro are equivalent) Readers 
I'm referring to the DJVU files that come with the 4 disc Rolling Stone archives cd-roms. The files are DJVU but they can't be converted to pdf as they're coded with heavy DRM. Is there anyway of getting into them so I can extract the individual pages and convert to jpg? I'm pretty sure it's the same system used in the complete New Yorker and Playboy collections too. It involves Bondi Reader, think this was released in 2007 or so. I've read online but there's no real method of stripping Djvu files are so much better than pdfs. They are tiny as compared to the pdf. So is there any way that I can open them on my kobo glo? (I tried pdf conversion of the djvu but they're too big! A 4 mb textbook in djvu converted to 167Mb in pdf wth.) Follow up question: how to add moonreader/ UB reader on the kobo in stead of the regular reader. I'm interested in a Kindle as an alternative to buying expensive textbooks this quarter. I can find a pdf or djvu most for most of my textbooks online, each ranging from a few to a hundred MBs. I'm looking to get more info as to how the Kindle handles these large PDFs (after conversion, I assume) and any other experience you might have with using the Kindle as a textbook reader. –ü—Ä–æ–≥—Ä–∞–º–º–∞ EBookDroid - PDF DJVU Reader –ø–æ–∑–≤–æ–ª–∏—Ç –í–∞–º –ø—Ä–µ–≤—Ä–∞—Ç–∏—Ç—å —Å–≤–æ–µ –∞–Ω–¥—Ä–æ–∏–¥ —É—Å—Ç—Ä–æ–π—Å—Ç–≤–æ –≤ –ø–ª–∞–Ω—à–µ—Ç. –í—Å–µ–º –ª—é–±–∏—Ç–µ–ª—è–º —á—Ç–µ–Ω–∏—è —ç–ª–µ–∫—Ç—Ä–æ–Ω–Ω—ã—Ö –≥–∞–∑–µ—Ç –∏ –∂—É—Ä–Ω–∞–ª–æ–≤ –Ω–µ–ø—Ä–µ–º–µ–Ω–Ω–æ–µ —Å—Ç–æ–∏—Ç –æ–±—Ä–∞—Ç–∏—Ç—å –ª–∏—á–Ω–æ–µ. –ò–∑–≤–µ—Å—Ç–Ω–∞—è —Å–µ–≥–æ–¥–Ω—è –Ω–∞ –ø—Ä–æ—Å—Ç–æ—Ä–∞—Ö —ç–ª–µ–∫—Ç—Ä–æ–Ω–Ω—ã—Ö –ø—Ä–∏–ª–æ–∂–µ–Ω–∏–π —Ç–µ—Ö–Ω–æ–ª–æ–≥–∏—è djvu –ø–æ—è–≤–∏–ª–∞—Å—å –Ω–∞ —Å–≤–µ—Ç. –ü—Ä–æ–≥—Ä–∞–º–º—ã –¥–ª—è —á—Ç–µ–Ω–∏—è PDF,DjVu. –í —ç—Ç–æ–º —Ä–∞–∑–¥–µ–ª–µ –ø—Ä–µ–¥–ª–∞–≥–∞–µ–º —Å–∫–∞—á–∞—Ç—å –ø—Ä–æ–≥—Ä–∞–º–º—ã, –∫–æ—Ç–æ—Ä—ã–µ –ø–æ–∑–≤–æ–ª—è—é—Ç. –õ—É—á—à–∏–π —Å–ø–æ—Å–æ–± —Å–∫–æ–Ω–≤–µ—Ä—Ç–∏—Ä–æ–≤–∞—Ç—å –≤–∞—à djvu-—Ñ–∞–π–ª –≤ pdf –∑–∞ —Å—á–∏—Ç–∞–Ω–Ω—ã–µ —Å–µ–∫—É–Ω–¥—ã. 100% –±–µ—Å–ø–ª–∞—Ç–Ω—ã–π.
